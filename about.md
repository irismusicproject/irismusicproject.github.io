The mission of the Iris Music Project, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, is to strengthen community wellness through daily musical experiences that foster joy, understanding, purpose and inspiration.

We partner with continuing care retirement communities, senior centers and other community venues to provide musical programming and experiences throughout these communities.

### Note from founder and cellist Lauren Latessa

I have always believed that my responsibility as a musician is to tap into the struggles and joys of the human condition.  In no moment do you understand this more clearly than walking into a room, knowing that your music will be the last sounds heard by a dear friend.  

The Iris Music Project is dedicated to exploring this connection between music and well-being.  Music has the awesome power to give all stages of life depth, beauty and meaning.  Used correctly, it makes all the difference: a moment of connection, a peaceful breath, a final smile.
