# Inspired Aging: Iris Piano Trio’s residency at Charles E. Smith Life Communities

The Iris Piano Trio is currently in residency at the Charles E. Smith Life Communities in Rockville, MD.  This unique, collaborative partnership is a one-of-a-kind experiment at the intersection of creative aging, well-being and chamber music. Iris Piano Trio’s holistic approach results in a new kind of community, one that connects older adults with musicians, cultivates a sense of purpose and transforms the lives of all involved. 

Chamber residencies like this are the hallmark of the iris music project and the specialty of its musicians.  Musicians collaborate with retirement communities, senior centers and community venues to perform regular concerts, lecture on musical subjects, mentor older adults in one-on-one sessions and lead group discussions.  Contact [laurenirismusic@gmail.com](mailto:laurenirismusic@gmail.com) for more information.

Residencies include: 

- Open rehearsals & performances
- Music Committee & other collaboratively designed music projects
- Intergenerational programs
- One-on-one and small group projects
- Choirs & drum circles
- Musical lectures & discussions
