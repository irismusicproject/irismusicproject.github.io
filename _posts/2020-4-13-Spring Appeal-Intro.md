title: Our 2020 Spring Fundraising Appeal
---

Hello Friends! Welcome to Musical Offerings: Iris Music's Spring Fundraising Appeal!  Join us each morning, from April 20-25, as we kick off our spring campaign with collaborative chamber music performances featuring Iris Musicians.  

This is a particularly dark moment for older adults who are now more isolated than ever. On April 6, we began remote programming for the Charles E. Smith Life Communities in Rockville MD, delivering innovative daily programming using high tech solutions like closed circuit television and the Internet. Additionally, we are personally engaging residents using email and phone calls, involving them in interactive programming that fights isolation.

It is so important that you, the friends and supporters who care most about our work, donate now to help sustain us through this difficult time. Your donation allows Iris to continue connecting with seniors, providing them with interludes of musical joy.  Eva, Jiyoung, Sara and Jessica have all shown such creativity and commitment as we take on these new challenges and face cancelled performances. We need to raise  $15,000 this spring to support our musicians and keep our programs going. Thank you for helping to make our work possible.

With gratitude,

Lauren
